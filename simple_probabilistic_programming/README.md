# Simple, Distributed, and Accelerated Probabilistic Programming

This directory contains reference code for the NIPS 2018 paper,
"Simple, Distributed, and Accelerated Probabilistic Programming". It's
organized as follows:

* [`no_u_turn_sampler/`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/simple_probabilistic_programming/no_u_turn_sampler):
  Eager-only implementation of the No-U-Turn Sampler.
* [`Companion.ipynb`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/simple_probabilistic_programming/Companion.ipynb):
  Jupyter notebook which expands on the paper's code snippets and examples.
